/**
 * MillerRabinSerial is a (multi)threaded implementation of the Miller-Rabin
 * primality test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test).
 * The implementation uses an ExecutorService interface that manages the execution of tasks.
 * Instead of the tasks (instances of MillerRabinCallable) using the Runnable interface,
 * they use the Callable interface, which means the tasks can return a result once they
 * are completed. The tasks in this implementation correspond to single Miller-Rabin trials.
 * See the docstring of the serial version for more information on the Miller-Rabin test.
 *
 * The results of the trials (booleans) are stored in a HashSet using the Future interface.
 * I'm not entirely sure how Future works but it represents a future result of an
 * asynchronous computation. The ExecutorService (sort of like a multiprocessing.Pool
 * in Python if I understand it correctly) uses the submit()-method, passing a Callable
 * as an argument, and returns a FutureTask object which is then added to the HashSet.
 * Once the tasks are completed, one can iterate over the HashSet and use the get()-method
 * on the FutureTasks to read the result of each finished task.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The way multithreading is implemented here is that the program waits for
 * all the threads to finish their work before presenting the results. In the case that
 * one is testing a composite number, the program will execute all trials before finishing,
 * even if the first trial proves that the number is composite. Hence this threaded
 * implementation is only really faster than the serial version if the number being tested
 * is a prime, since then all trials would need to be executed. Thus the threaded version
 * is mostly useful as an mediocre example of multithreading, or when testing a number that is
 * already suspected to be prime. Some large known primes can be found in the Primes
 * class for testing purposes.
