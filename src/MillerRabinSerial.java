/**
 * MillerRabinSerial is a standard (serial) implementation of the Miller-Rabin
 * primality test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test).
 *
 * The Miller-Rabin primality test relies essentially on a mathematical fact that asserts
 * that if 'n' is a prime, then (a statement involving 'n' and 'x') holds for all integers 'x'.
 * Hence to test if an integer 'n' is a prime, the test checks to see if it can find an
 * integer 'x' such that the statement does not hold. In that case, the integer x is called
 * a "Miller-Rabin witness for the compositeness of n", as 'n' has been proven to not be prime.
 *
 * The test is probabilistic, meaning it does not determine without doubt that an integer is prime,
 * it can only tell us that it is very likely a prime (although there are ways to make the test
 * deterministic). This means that if a test is done on a composite number, the test may finish
 * very quickly since a single witness is enough to prove without a doubt that the number was
 * composite.
 *
 * The test is effective due to the fact that one can show that if 'n' is composite, then at least
 * 75% of all integers between 1 and 'n-1' are Miller-Rabin witnesses for 'n'. Moreover, for most
 * composite numbers the number of witnesses are much higher, resulting in a higher average
 * probability that the test is correct.
 *
 * In this implementation as well as in the threaded implementation, one trial refers to taking
 * a random integer 'x' and checking whether it is a witness for the integer being tested. If a
 * number of trials is done, say, 10, then by the above fact the probability that the test asserts
 * the correct result is bounded by 1 - (1/4)^10 (not strictly correct, but it's a good estimate).
 * Hence it's possible to achieve a very high accuracy of the test by doing just a few trials.
 *
